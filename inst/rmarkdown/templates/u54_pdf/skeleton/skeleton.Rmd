# R Markdown Report
This is the actual report. It can include figures, tables and other data
suitable for a data science report.


```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Add packages here that you use, but don't load via library.
rlang::check_installed(c("base"))

# dplyr can conflict with other packages, but the pipe is universally helpful.
# We could start using the new R4.0 pipe |>
library(magrittr)

# Knitr options are helpful, such as turning off code blocks.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.5, fig.height=6, # This works for 1in margins, use 7.5/6 for 0.5 margins
  fig.path="Figures/", # Store the figures, handing for referring back to the report
  echo=FALSE, # Turn off code blocks
  warning=TRUE, # Turn off warnings and messages. Only do when you know what they are.
  message=TRUE,
  fig.align="left" # Left align figures to get most space.
)
```

# Examples

We can see a figure such as Figure \@ref(fig:plot-cars). Or a table such as Table \@ref(tab:cars-table).

```{r plot-cars, fig.cap="Plot of the first two variables of cars dataset."}
plot(cars)
```

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  summary(cars),
  caption="Numerical summary of the cars dataset using summary.",
  booktabs = TRUE
) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

ATTENTION: The code below will accumulate all of the code blocks and print them out
here, as section (called Code). This allows you to still have the code but not clutter
the report.

# Code
This section includes all of the code blocks from this report, in order to facilitate 
reproducible research and provide additional details on the report. 

```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

ATTENTION: The below text should remain at the bottom of your markdown
as it provides tables about the runtime environment. You should leave
everything from the start of this paragraph down at the end of the

The information in this section is included in the report to facilitate reproducible research. The specific environment under which the code was run is detailed.
